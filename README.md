# ESP32 WeVibe Rave emulator
An ESP-32 firmware for emulating a WeVibe Rave. For connecting a custom single-channel vibrator to XToys/Buttplug.io 

Based off abla7e/ESP32-Lovense, which is based off MonomoriumP's firmware (https://github.com/MonomoriumP/Buttplug.io--Lelo). The change of emulated device is to be able to access the 0-100 control signals available to the WeVibe, rather than the 0-20 of the Lovense.
